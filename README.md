# Project: 2D UFO Game
## Team Members: Weijia Tang, Sophia Jiang

## What we did
We built a UFO Game using Unity2D. We followed an online tutorial https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/2d-ufo-tutorial

## How we split the work
We coded together side by side for the whole time.

## How to play the game,
Go to `Builds` and click on `UFO Game builds1`.

## What we learnt
We learnt how to build a game with Unity2D since neither of us has experience with that before.
We followed the tutorial and achieved everything required by this game.
Next step, we are thinking about adding extra features to the game like setting up a timer, make a multiple players mode, etc.
